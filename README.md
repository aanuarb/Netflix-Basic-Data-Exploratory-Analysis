# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis V1

## About Dataset

This data set was created to list all shows available on Netflix streaming, and analyze the data to find interesting facts. This data was acquired in May 2022 containing data available in the United States.

## Objectives

Using real-world dataset from Kaggle, I wanted to utilize the skills and knowledge that I've learned into practicing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset provides a lot of valueable and non-valuable information for me to perform the cleaning process and dive into EDA.

EDA includes understanding:
- Which type of content is widely available
- What genres makes up the majority of the content
- Which movies have the highest IMDB score
- Which actor/director receives the highest popularity vote
- Simple recommendation tool using the random function

End.
